## Workflow

- Check: `claude plugin validate .`.

## Maintaining orbit

- pstack (`cursor/plugins` at the `sha` in `skills.json`) is the reference. Copy its wording and names. Record each divergence in `docs/pstack-differences.md`.
- A local edit to a vendored skill gets a line in that skill's `edits` in `skills.json`. Otherwise `/update-skills` drops the edit.
- Bump `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` so installs pick up the change.
